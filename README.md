# Prodigy_ML_01

This is the first task of my Prodigy Infotech Internship,
I made a linear regression model on house prediction dataset 
which contains 79 indepedent variables and 1 depedent
variable making it a total of 80 columns. 

Linear regression is a very simple algorithm requiring 
a lot of pre-requisite conditions for its data,
which i tried to cover, almost all of them.
